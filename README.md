# Problem
When downloading mods for Rimworld with RimPy I would run into an issue where existing mod files were just overwritten but never deleted.
So if a mod author updated their mod and deleted a file, due to how RimPy and Steamcmd work, it would never be deleted for me. This tool helps solve that.

# Instructions
1. Rename your `steamcmd.exe` to `steamcmd-original.exe`.
2. Paste the `steamcmd.exe` from this project in its place so that it gets used instead.

Backups will be timestamped zips.
